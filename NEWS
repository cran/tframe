                 CHANGES IN TFRAME VERSION 2007.5-1

Changes (Possibly) Affecting Users

    o  the function freeze was moved from tframe to TSpadiFame.

    o  tfplot and tfOnePlot were changed to call plot in place of
      matplot, so x scale for zoo time series works better.

    o  xlab was modified to allow vector argument specifying label
       for each plot.

    o  methods for zoo and its were added.

    o  tbind was modified to handle a possible NULL first argument,
        in order to make initialization for use in a loop easier.

    o  as.tframe was added to generate a tframe using start, end, 
        frequency, periods.

    o  as.tframed was added to gaurantee an object is tframed.

    o  arguments start, end, and ... were added to tframed so it can be
       used more easily to generate default ts like time series.

    o  annualizedGrowth utility for calculating annualized growth  
       of a time series was added.

    o  tfL utility for shifting a tframe or tframed data was added.
       For data this is equivalent to lag but the default is to lag the data.

    o  tfdiff methods were replaced diff.tframe and diff.tframed.

    o  added utilities tsWrite and tsScan for reading and writing 
       time series (csv) data files (wrappers for scan and write).

 
Changes Affecting Development

    o  tfSet was (re) introduced, as switching the dispatch order for tframe<-
      seems to be a much cleaner approach.
